--The SQL queries provided cover various aspects like user behavior, page visits, conversion rates, and traffic analysis, helping in drawing meaningful insights for optimizing website performance.


/* Now some Complex SQL queries involving Common Table Expressions (CTEs), joins, and window functions along with explanations for each:

1]User Journey Analysis CTE:
  This query tracks and lists the user journey on the website, connecting page visits in sequence for each user*/

WITH user_journey AS (
    SELECT user_id, STRING_AGG(page_url, ' -> ') AS journey
    FROM page_views
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT user_id, journey
FROM user_journey
LIMIT 10;

--Purpose: It reveals the specific paths users take on the website, aiding in understanding navigation behavior.



--2]Average Time Spent Using Window Function:
--  Calculates the average time spent by users on each page and ranks pages accordingly.

SELECT page_url, AVG(time_spent) OVER (PARTITION BY page_url) AS avg_time_spent
FROM page_views
ORDER BY avg_time_spent DESC;

--Purpose: Helps identify the most engaging pages based on the average time users spend on them.


--3]Conversion Funnel Analysis with Joins:
--  Analyzes user journeys by joining multiple tables to track conversions through different steps.

SELECT p.user_id, STRING_AGG(p.page_url, ' -> ') AS user_journey
FROM page_views p
JOIN conversions c ON p.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY p.user_id;

--Purpose: Provides insights into user paths leading to conversions, aiding in optimizing the conversion funnel.


--4]Ranking High-Value Customers with Window Function:
--  Ranks users based on their total spending using a window function.

SELECT user_id, total_spending, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spending DESC) AS spending_rank
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, SUM(purchase_value) AS total_spending
