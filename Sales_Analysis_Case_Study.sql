Case Study: Sales Analysis for Performance Improvement


Problem Statement:
A company aims to enhance its sales performance by analyzing sales data to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement. The current sales data analysis is insufficient in providing insights for better decision-making.


Aim:
Utilize SQL to analyze sales data comprehensively, identify key performance indicators, and make informed decisions to improve sales performance.


Objectives:
Analyze sales data to understand customer behavior and buying patterns.
Identify top-selling products, customer segments, and geographical sales trends.
Measure conversion rates, customer retention, and average order value.
Implement strategies to enhance sales performance and optimize revenue.


SQL Tasks:
Total Sales Amount: Calculate the total sales amount.
Top Selling Products: Identify the most sold products.
Customer Segmentation: Analyze sales based on customer segments.
Conversion Rates: Measure conversion rates for specific actions (e.g., lead to sale).
Geographic Sales Analysis: Identify sales trends across different regions.
Customer Retention: Analyze repeat purchases and customer retention rates.
Average Order Value: Calculate the average value of orders.
Trend Analysis: Identify sales trends over time.
Product Performance Analysis: Analyze performance metrics for each product.
Forecasting and Prediction: Use statistical functions to forecast future sales.

FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_segment;

-- 4. Conversion Rates
SELECT action, COUNT(*) AS total_actions, COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales) AS conversion_rate
FROM actions_table
GROUP BY action;

-- 5. Geographic Sales Analysis
SELECT region, SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales_amount
FROM sales
GROUP BY region;

-- 6. Customer Retention
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_purchases, COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers) AS retention_rate
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- 7. Average Order Value
SELECT AVG(order_value) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders;

-- 8. Trend Analysis

ORDER BY month;

-- 9. Product Performance Analysis
SELECT product_id, AVG(sale_amount) AS avg_sale_amount, COUNT(*) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;

-- 10. Forecasting and Prediction
SELECT product_id, DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS predicted_month, AVG(sale_amount) AS predicted_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date);


--11. Customer Segmentation Analysis using CTE:
WITH segment_sales AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT CASE 
           WHEN total_sales > 5000 THEN 'High Value'
           WHEN total_sales > 2000 THEN 'Medium Value'
           ELSE 'Low Value'
       END AS customer_segment,
       COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM segment_sales
GROUP BY customer_segment;

/*Justification: Utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) to segment customers based on their total purchase amounts.

Purpose: Identifies customer segments for targeted marketing strategies and personalized campaigns.

Findings: Shows the count of customers falling into different value-based segments.*/



--12. Sales Trend Analysis using Window Function:
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS sale_month,
       SUM(sale_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)) AS monthly_sales
FROM sales;

/*Justification: Uses a window function to calculate the cumulative sum of sales amount over months.

Purpose: Identifies sales trends and patterns over time to recognize seasonal trends or monthly variations.

Findings: Presents monthly sales amounts and reveals months with higher or lower sales.*/



--13. Product Performance Comparison with Joins:
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, COALESCE(SUM(s.sale_amount), 0) AS total_sales_amount
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sales_amount DESC;

/*Justification: Utilizes a LEFT JOIN to list all products and their respective sales amounts, including products with zero sales.

Purpose: Helps identify top-selling products and those that might require additional marketing efforts.

Findings: Lists products with their sales amounts, showcasing top-performing products.*/



--14. Average Order Value Calculation:
SELECT order_id, AVG(order_value) OVER () AS avg_order_value
FROM orders;

/*Justification: Uses a window function to calculate the overall average order value.

Purpose: Provides insight into the average monetary value of orders placed.

Findings: Displays the average order value for all orders.*/



--15. Customer Purchase Patterns Using Lag Function:
SELECT customer_id, order_date, 
       LAG(order_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS previous_order_date
FROM sales;

/*Justification: Utilizes the LAG window function to identify the previous order date for each customer.

Purpose: Analyzes the time gap between consecutive purchases made by customers.

Findings: Reveals the time lapse between a customer's current and previous purchase dates.*/



--16. Sales Forecasting Using Statistical Functions:
SELECT product_id, DATE_ADD(order_date, INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS predicted_month, AVG(sale_amount) AS predicted_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date);

/*Justification: Forecasts sales for the next month using statistical average.

Purpose: Provides a predictive analysis of expected sales for the upcoming month.

Findings: Predicts potential sales amounts for each product in the following month.*/



--17. Customer Retention Rate Calculation with Window Function:
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
       COUNT(*) / COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS retention_rate
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;

/*Justification: Uses a window function to calculate the customer retention rate.

Purpose: Measures the rate at which customers make repeat purchases.

Findings: Indicates the percentage of repeat orders for each customer.*/



--18. Geographical Sales Performance Using Subquery:
SELECT region, country, 
       (SELECT SUM(sale_amount) FROM sales WHERE s.region = region) AS total_sales_amount
FROM sales s
GROUP BY region, country;

/*Justification: Includes a subquery to calculate total sales amounts for each region and country.

Purpose: Analyzes sales performance based on geographical locations.

Findings: Highlights sales performance in different regions and countries.*/

SELECT m1.sale_month, m1.total_sales AS current_month_sales, 
       m2.total_sales AS previous_month_sales
FROM monthly_sales m1
LEFT JOIN monthly_sales m2 ON m1.sale_month = m2.sale_month + 1;

/*Justification: Uses a CTE and self-join to compare sales between consecutive months.

Purpose: Compares sales performance between the current and previous months.

Findings: Compares sales amounts between the current month and the preceding month.*/



--20. Customer Lifetime Value Analysis with Aggregation:
SELECT customer_id, 
       SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales_amount, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
       SUM(sale_amount) / COUNT(*) AS avg_order_value
